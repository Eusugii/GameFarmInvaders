# GameFarmInvaders
This is a game created in pygame

https://github.com/Eusugii/CSEL2L - link for the sound and images assets folder. The folder should be included on the same folder of all the game files.

This game version just lacks the replayability which is easy to create by just creating another for loop for a new user input when the player is dead.
